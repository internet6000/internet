# Project Destiny
Project Destiny is the mother project to download the entire internet and make an offline available version of it which is open source and free for everyone to use for whatever purpose they may want, without the worry of viruses, suspicious websites and other illegal materials all stored in the "Criminal Vault." Destiny is not quite finished yet, still in the early stages and probably not even possible with present day technology.

Financially, we are not doing very well at all. Considering storage, assuming that the current day internet data is a reasonable 10 exabytes, you will need 10485760 terabytes of data. As of 15/07/2022, you will need 655360 of the latest 16TB Samsung SSD or 524288 of Seagate Ironwolf's 20TB drives. We would also need the world's best internet connection, or millions of connections running at the same time downloading different parts of the internet. The second option would be resource wasting but also more reasonable and realistic.
